# 🏨 Hotel Performance Analytics Dashboard

## 📝 Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive performance analysis of a hotel chain across multiple cities and booking platforms. It was designed to give business stakeholders a clear view of key revenue and operational metrics — enabling better data-driven decision-making for occupancy, revenue management, and platform performance.

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset contains anonymized hotel performance data including:
- Property details (name, city, ID)
- Revenue, bookings, and occupancy
- ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
- DSRN, DBRN, DURN: stay-related metrics
- Booking platform-wise performance
- Ratings and cancellation rates

Data was cleaned, modeled, and visualized in Power BI.
